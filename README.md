# Gnome shell extension for Docker

## Motivation

During a school project, I had to manage a lot of docker containers. Always going into a terminal to run `docker run xxx` was not really productive, so I decided to develop this extension.

## Usage

When installing this extension, you will be able to manage your docker containers.

The following actions are available :

- Start
- Pause
- Stop
